# General Questions

1. What excites or interests you about coding? What did you learn this week?
   > Exploring different problems and solving it is what excites me about coding. It feels like a game of puzzle and writing code is like finding a new path to a goal in a puzzle. This week I learnt about authentication and authorization with JWT in Nest js.
2. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
   > Recently I encountered problems with implementing Github authentication in Nest js. I was getting a `can't resolve circular dependency` error while passing the req object to a service method. I solved it by first googling the error I got and finding more about circular dependency in Nest js. Secondly I tried to flattend the object request object. It required a third party library. Lastly, after trying to log out the request object and accessing the `req.user` object directly I found that was what led to the error and was solved after I spread the object `{...req}`.
3. Talk about your preferred development environment (tools and technologies you prefer using) or a cool project that you've recently worked on (if any).

   > Recently I have tried using **Nest js** and **Next js**. I found to prefer creating APIs now using **Nest js** and usually all my react projects using **Next js**.

4. What is your general expectation from this internship program?
   > I expect to gain professional experience through this internship and pave my way into getting a fulltime web developer role. My aim has always been to be a Full-stack web developer and through this internship I would like to get experience in both domains of web development.
5. What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?
   > The mediums that I prefer to learn programming is via tutorial videos to get started and blog articles for after that and then building projects.
